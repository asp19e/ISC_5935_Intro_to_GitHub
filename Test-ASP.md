<u><p align=center>Intro to Github</p></u>

* I have no questions yet. It's been a while since I've used GitHub (Fall 2020) so I just need to get more used to it.

* In the past, I used SourceTree for my projects, but this is the first time I'm learning about using Git in the command-line.

* This line was added natively as a pert of the text file. The next one would have been added through a `commit`.
